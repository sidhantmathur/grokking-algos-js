# Exercises

Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names. Max steps?

log2(128) = Â 7

Suppose you double the size of the list. What's the max steps now?

log2(256) = 8

This is logical because the first step of binary search is cutting the list in half, making a doubling of elements only one extra step for the algorithm.
